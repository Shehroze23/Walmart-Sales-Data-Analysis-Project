# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I cleaned a dataset containing Walmart sales data and analyzed sales, unemployment rate, CPI, fuel price, and other fields. Additionally, I created interactive visualizations using Tableau to effectively present and explore trends, correlations, and key insights derived from the data.
